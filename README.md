25/08/2021: First I worked on the basic functionality, creating some basic math operations, as well as an operate function to use them based on an operator value. Next, I built with HTML the basic structure of the calculator, and gave it a basic appearance. 

Finally, I added EventListeners to the number buttons so they display their values.

27/08/2021: I started adding functionality to the calculator. Getting the operator buttons to work was a bit harder than I expected it, but it was fun. Now they work although the equal button behaves anormaly when pressed after an operator (Basically it uses the stored values). So I need to fix that. Today I learned more about the relation betten Javascript and the DOM elements, also I used the google console and debugging system more, so I'm getting used to it. That's all for today.

30/08/2021: Today I fixed the Equal bug and added the 0 division error to the equal operator. Also, I added the clear button.
